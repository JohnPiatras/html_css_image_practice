        <p id="answer1i" class="answer indent">Light microscopy can be used for stained or unstained
          specimens. Within the routine section light microscopy is principally
          used for examination of Gram films
          under oil immersion but also to examine unstained wet preparations of
          suspected yeast colonies
          at low power to confirm by morphology.  In other sections light
          microscopy is used to examine modified ZN stained films under oil
          immersion to confirm Cryptosporidium positive faeces specimens,
          examine vaginal smears for Trichomonas vaginalis and examine faecal
          concentrates for parasites.</p>

      <div id="question1ii" class="question-part indent">
        <div class="statement">
          <h4>ii) Phase contrast Microscopy - when is this used?</h4>
        </div>
        <p id = "answer1ii_exp" class="indent">&#x229e</p>
        <p id="answer1ii" class="answer indent">Phase contrast microscopy is used for unstained
          specimens to enhance visibility and contrast of cells and structures
          by showing phase changes as differing brightness.  A phase contrast
          microscope is available at the urine bench and is used for examination
          of urgent urine specimens out of hours when the automated system is
          shut down.</p>

        <p id="answer1iii" class="answer indent">To calculate the magnification of a microscope
          multiply the power of the objective lens by the power of the

            cultures, sterile fluids, tissue specimens, penile swabs and any
            suspicious colonies to aid in identification.</p>
          <p>Overleaf, table 7.6b (reproduced from section 7.6 Blood Culture
            Samples) details the common bacteria and fungi seen in blood
            cultures and their Gram stain appearance.</p>

          <p>Differential staining is used for CSF specimens with an elevated white cell count (â‰¥ 20/mm3) to allow the proportion of polymorphs to lymphocytes to be determined which will give an indication of the nature of the infection i.e. bacterial or viral.</p>

          <p>The photographs of differential stains below (taken by Kirstie Burns) highlight the different cell types that can be observed.</p>
